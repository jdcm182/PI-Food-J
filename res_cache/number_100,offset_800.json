This is my most popular recipe on my blog  which you can find here: http://sallycooks.com/2013/06/27/crockpot-cashew-chicken/ Happy cooking!I know you know how bad take-out Chinese food is for your waistline and your wallet.  The good news is that it is easy  to make your favorites at home, using less sodium and more fresh or frozen produce.In about the time it takes to order and pick up Chinese, you can make a healthier version of cashew chicken with this simple, throw it all in the crockpot recipe.  I think if I were to make this again I would roast the cashews to crisp them up and add them before serving rather than cooking them alongside the chicken.   I used frozen broccoli but fresh would be fine too.I served with a green salad but my Better-than-Takeout Chicken Fried Rice would be a great side, just leave out the chicken.What to do:layer chicken, cashews and vegetables in the crockpotcombine remaining ingredients except water and pour over chicken in crockpotadd water or broth if necessary so mixture is almost completely coveredcook for 2-4 hours on high or 4-8 hours on low",

If it starts to smoke too much, turn down the heat a little.4.Once you can see that the duck has cooked about a little more than half way by looking at the side of it to see the colour change, it should be transferred to the oven.  This should take about 10 to 15 minutes, but of course it depends on the thickness of your duck and the intensity of the heat you use to cook it.  You can do this in your pan if it has a metal handle, or you can transfer the duck to a roasting tray if your pan has a plastic or other unsuitable handle which wont withstand the heat of the oven.  I do the latter.  If you are planning to do this too, heat the roasting tray in the oven beforehand.  The easiest way to do this is to place it in there whilst you wait for the oven to reach temperature.  The duck should be placed in the oven skin side down.5.Once in the oven, cook it for a further 7 to 10 minutes.",

If you cannot find a smoked ham hock (usually found in the freezer section) and you do not have any cooked ham available, use bone-in smoked ham. (If you want a really meaty soup, use 2 pounds instead of 1.)Cook the bacon in 6-quart stock pot or Dutch oven and drain on paper towels.",
