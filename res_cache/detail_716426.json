This sandy, rocky dinosaur boneyard vineyard has rapidly become one of the more sought-after sites for this noble variety on the Left Coast, and has the unusual atmospheric element of being surrounded by an active oilfield, suggesting deep geologic origins for its focused, mineral aspect. Harvested before dawn on August 27th, this is perhaps the most tightly-wound vintage we’ve yet produced from the site, and we expect it to be drinking beautifully for a number of years. Fermentation with indigenous yeast took place in stainless, and élevage sur lie continued through the spring in stainless and neutral French oak barrels.","price":"$25.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/478838-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":5,"score":0.8175000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbirichino-jurassic-park-vineyard-old-vines-chenin-blanc-2015%2F400659"}]},"instructions":"<ol><li><span></span>Remove the cauliflower's tough stem and reserve for another use.
