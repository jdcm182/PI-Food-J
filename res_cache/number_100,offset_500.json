Using a potato masher break up the beans a bit.Allow to simmer for about 10-12 minutes, until thickened to the consistency of a refried bean. Season with salt and pepper. Finish with a squeeze of lime and a handful of chopped cilantro. So yummy!!!!!Heres what I did for the shredded chicken. I started out by popping 3 chicken breasts, a tsp of peppercorns, a bay leaf and a quart of broth into the slow cooker and letting it go on low for 2.5 hours. Once it was done I shredded the chicken using two forks then popped the chicken right back into the broth. I made this for several different meals, including yesterdays soup, so you only use a portion here.All you have left to do is warm the chicken in a small pan with the salsa. Once warmed through, give a little squeeze and the cilantro.",

If you like your lamb medium place it in the oven for 9 to 11 minutes. If you like it well done leave it in there for 12-14 minutes.

(extra for pizza too)In a food processor we're going to put our basil, the cheese, soaked almonds, little salt and pepper, and 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil.Process it on and off for thirty seconds.Then drizzle in the rest of the olive oil while the food processor is on. This makes sure you get the optimal consistency for your likings.When it's made fresh the oil tends to separate from the other ingredients. I suggest serving this after it's been in the refrigerator for an hour because the pesto rests and stays together better.When the dough has doubled plop it onto a lightly dusted countertop and move it around so the entire dough gets covered.Divide it into thirds.Preheat the oven to 500F and place a baking stone on the middle rack. (you can also use an overturned cookie sheet)NOTE: The baking stone/cookie sheet has to be larger than the size of the pizza you are making, otherwise it will hang over the edges and burn onto the oven rack.Coat one ball of dough with flour and place it on a well-floured surface. Using your fingertips, gently flatten the dough into an 8-inch disk, leaving an inch or so of outer edge thicker than the center.Using your hands, gently stretch it into a 10-12 inch round, working along the edges and giving the dough quarter turns as you stretch it.",

Grind with the remaining ingredients in a clean coffee grinder and store in a tightly lidded jar.This rich flavoursome dish originates in the fertile Punjab, a state now divided between India and Pakistan. There is nothing more important to a Punjabi man's diet than bread, and meals are accompanied by flat round cornbread rotis or rich, flaky pan-fried paratha layered with ghee(clarified butter).Rice is reserved for special occasions or for rice pudding, for the only food that makes a Punjabi feel he has eaten a proper meal is his bread! You of course, can serve this dish with plain boiled rice.",

Once roasted, use a knife to remove the soft flesh from each clove. It should slip out easily and be very soft.To make the cashew sauce, drain and rinse the cashews that have been soaking for at least 8 hours. Then add to a food processor with the water, salt, garlic powder and roasted garlic cloves. Blend on a high speed in a food processor, or ideally a high speed blender until completely smooth. If you can't get it completely smooth, that's still fine.",
