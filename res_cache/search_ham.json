It normally takes a few minutes to get to this stage.  Try to resist messing around with your pancake too soon as this will cause it to stick.  An indication that the pancake is ready is that little air pockets will start to appear.You can either flip your pancake with a spatula or toss it in the pan.  Cook on the other side for a few minutes until golden brown.  If you are like me, your first pancake may not be the best, but they will improve as you go along.Slide your pancake out onto a clean plate, put some greaseproof paper on it and move on to the next one.
