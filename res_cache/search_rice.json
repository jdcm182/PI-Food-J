Adjust heat as necessary to maintain a simmer cooking for 15~20 minutes.2.Meanwhile, rinse the rice cake slices in cold water and drain well.3.Stir in the rice cake slices and the 2 tablespoons soup soy sauce. Boil gently about 8~10 minutes or until the rice cake slices start to float. Season with a little salt and pepper.  When rice cakes are almost cooked, include the scallion slices and beaten egg.4.Make the garnish ingredients by separating the egg whites and yolks. In a non-stick pan or skillet, add olive oil and fry them in olive oil into a thin sheet; transfer to cutting board and cut into thin strips. Toast gim (seaweed) sheets over heat until crispy; cut into thin strips.5.Ladle the soup into bowls, dividing the rice cake slices evenly. For each serving, place a nice handful of the fried egg white, yolks, and seaweed strips.6.Eat hot otherwise the rice cakes will \"booluh,\" or get soggy.*Most Koreans include mandu (dumplings) with tteokguk to make it heartier. If doing so, simply add them in the broth a few minutes before the rice cakes. These ingredients are available at Korean grocers and supermarkets with well-stocked Asian food sections.",

Cook just until the the onion and garlic softens, about 7 minutes or so.While your veggies are cooking, chop up your kale and get it ready to go, but don't add it yet.  You don't need to worry about chopping the spinach leaves, when it comes time to add them, just use the whole leaf.Once your veggies are cooked, drain your lentils and add them and the rice to the veggies. If you can't find a black rice, just use wild rice.Give the veggies, rice and lentils a stir and then add your veggie broth, water, kale, spinach and all of the spices and turn the heat to high.Keep the burner on high just until the soup boils, reduce the heat to low and cover for 25 minutes. Covering the soup will ensure that the lentils and rice cook thoroughly.After the soup cooks covered for 25 minutes, remove the cover and continue to cook on low for another 30 minutes or so.  I added another 1/2 tsp of salt and a bit of pepper for flavoring at this point and it was a perfect balance.After the final 30 minutes of simmer, simply serve and enjoy!",
