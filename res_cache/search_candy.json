Once it's melted, remove it from the heat and add in your brown sugar, vanilla, and evaporated milk.Next up, you'll mix in your egg.Finish it off by adding in your flour and baking soda.Grab your cooled pretzel crust and lay your kisses down in rows on top of your crust.Next up, you'll grab your batter you just cooked up and pour it over the top of the kisses.Pop the bars back into your oven at 350 degrees and cook them for another 25 minutes.Once they're out and cooling, the final touch will be to take any leftover caramel kisses, throw them into your double boiler along with your tsp of milk and melt them down.",

If the temperature cooled, turn heat back on to high until it comes back up to 220 degrees F.When it is at a soft peak stage resembling marshmallow fluff, slowly add the hot sugar along the edge of the mixer avoiding the whisk.Continue to whisk on high until the bowl has cooled, about 5-8 minutes.Refrigerate for 5 minutes before transferring to a piping bag with a plain tip attached.Pipe frosting on cooled cupcakes along the edges then center by pumping frosting out as you keep the tip in the center gently lifting it up to get a multi-layer look.",

Make sure your bowl does not touch the simmering water. The more you stir the shinier your cookies will be.When the chocolate and shortening has melted, remove the bowl from the heat; stir to assure it's completely mixed. Set aside to cool a few minutes.Meanwhile, in another bowl, whisk together the sugar, eggs, vanilla paste, and espresso. Set aside.In another bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. Set aside.",
