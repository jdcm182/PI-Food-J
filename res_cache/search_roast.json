It would be a great side dish in place of traditional mashed potatoes this Thanksgiving.I added roasted garlic to the recipe to give the cauliflower mash a richer flavor.  It’s easy to roast garlic in a few steps.Simply preheat your oven to 400 degrees, peel off the outer layers of the garlic bulb skin, leaving the skins of the individual cloves intact.
